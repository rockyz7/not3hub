# NoteHub

Journal app to keep track of all your notes and to-do lists

The app is using Firestore as its database to save journal entries. User registration and authentication is provided by Google Firebase.

In addition to adding notes and to-do lists, the application also allows the functionality of uploading images which will later be stored in Cloudinary.

It was created with React using Redux for its state management, whereas the styles were implemented using Tailwindcss.
